	<h2>Hi, I'm Richard</h2>

		I'm a Product Manager passionate about building great products, exploring the frontiers of AI,
		and understanding how technology shapes the way we work and live.

	<h3>What I Do</h3>
	<p>
		By day, I work on product strategy and execution, helping teams ship products that solve real problems.
		I'm particularly interested in how AI is transforming product development - from the tools we use to
		build products, to the products themselves.
