> How Simple Alarms Transformed My Productivity and Mental Health

**Discover the surprising power of your device's built-in alarm app to overcome distractions, manage time effectively, and enhance well-being.**

The day I had been dreaming of finally arrived—a virtual meeting with the founder of the company I had always admired. This was my chance to make a lasting impression and secure the job I had always wanted. With just a click away, there was no excuse for missing it.

But as the meeting time approached, I got distracted. An article caught my eye, and before I knew it, I was lost in thought, reading about the latest trends. The clock ticked away unnoticed until it was too late. I was late to the meeting—late enough that it felt inexcusable.

I didn't even attempt to make excuses. The opportunity I had worked so hard for seemed to slip through my fingers due to a simple distraction. The moment I logged in, the founder's disappointment was palpable. While he was gracious about my tardiness, I felt as though I had already blown my opportunity.

## Spotting the Problem

As a product manager, I looked at this problem as an issue waiting to be solved. I'm not alone in this struggle. Many people face these challenges daily:

- **Time Blindness:** Losing track of time and missing important deadlines.
- **Overwhelming Notifications:** When device alerts become background noise.
- **Struggling to Focus:** Needing deep concentration but getting sidetracked easily.
- **Anxiety and Guilt:** Stressing over missed deadlines or being late, impacts mental health.

Research from the University of California, Irvine, says it takes about 23 minutes to refocus after being distracted. That's a lot of wasted time!

Recognising these common issues, I set out to find a practical and effective solution.

## Meet Your New Best Friend: The Alarm App

You might expect a high-tech, cutting-edge app to solve these problems, but the answer was right under my nose the whole time—my device's built-in alarm app. It's free, reliable, and remarkably effective.

Unlike the many sophisticated productivity apps I had tried, the simple alarm app had the power to break through my distractions. It's a tool you probably use daily to wake up in the morning, but its potential for time management is often overlooked.

**Here's Why It Works:**

- **Persistence:** Alarms are loud enough to grab your attention, no matter how engrossed you are.
- **Cross-Platform Utility:** Whether you use iOS or Android, alarms are universally applicable.
- **Customisability:** With features like Apple Shortcuts, you can automate and customise alarms to fit your schedule perfectly.

Cal Newport, in his book *Deep Work*, emphasises the importance of minimising distractions to achieve high levels of concentration and productivity. Similarly, James Clear points out in *Atomic Habits* that systems, such as using alarms, are crucial for maintaining focus and discipline.

## Find Your Focus by Kicking Out Distractions

Want to focus like a laser beam? Sometimes you need to cut out distractions. Just like musicians retreat to remote studios to create their albums, using alarms can help you shut out the noise and get creative.

Nir Eyal, in *Indistractable*, talks about planning ahead with tools like alarms to keep focus in check. Unlike Pomodoro timers or simply turning off notifications, alarms gave me the freedom to dive deep into my work.

The result? I could think more deeply and be more creative than ever before. This setup not only facilitated hyper-focus but also enabled me to explore my creativity and think deeply, resulting in higher-quality work and increased productivity.

## The Mental Health Connection

Before I embraced this simple solution, my life was a cycle of stress and anxiety. Being late to important meetings or deadlines often left me feeling anxious and guilty, which negatively impacted my self-esteem and overall mental health.

Using alarms changed that. The ability to rely on a simple system meant I could focus on my work without the constant worry of forgetting something important. This peace of mind has been invaluable. My anxiety levels decreased, and my confidence increased as I became more punctual and reliable.

## A Quick Note on Calendar Habits

While the power of alarms can transform your time management, it's essential to have good habits when using your calendar. Set realistic appointments, estimate task durations accurately, and make sure your schedule reflects your priorities. A strong calendar foundation is key to making alarms work their magic.

## Epilogue: A Second Chance

Despite my turning up to the interview late, the founder was gracious enough to overlook my tardiness. He appreciated my skills and enthusiasm, ultimately offering me the job. I was very fortunate – it could have turned out very differently. I don't want to be in that position again and I hope that none of you do either.

This experience motivated me to find a fix that worked for me. I've learned the hard way that the simplest tools can make the biggest difference. By embracing the humble alarm app, I turned my time management woes into a superpower. It improved not only my productivity but also my mental health. I hope it can do the same for you.
