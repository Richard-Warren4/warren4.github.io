# When Hyperfocus Meets Reality

Have you ever been so deeply focused on something that the world around you just… disappears? That's my daily reality. As someone who thrives on diving deep into complex data and processes, my ability to hyperfocus has been both my superpower and my kryptonite.

Let me tell you a story about how I learned this the hard way.

Picture this: I'm preparing for what could be a life-changing final interview. Fifteen minutes before the call, I think to myself, "I'll just relax for a moment." Next thing I know, I'm five minutes late to meet the founder. Sure, they were gracious about it, but I was furious with myself. Here I was, thoroughly prepared for the interview, yet my tendency to get lost in my own world had potentially sabotaged the opportunity.

This wasn't an isolated incident. Throughout my career as an individual contributor, I've excelled at diving into details, documenting complex processes, and producing clear summaries. My hyperfocus allowed me to create thoughtful, creative work. But there was always a cost: I'd regularly surface from these deep-work sessions only to find a string of "Where are you?" messages on Slack.

The standard solutions didn't work. Calendar notifications? I'd become desensitized to them. Meeting reminders? "Just five more minutes" would turn into fifteen. Each late arrival chipped away at my confidence and left me feeling like I was disrespecting my colleagues' time – which couldn't have been further from the truth.

Something had to change.

## The Birth of Oi-U!

Instead of fighting my hyperfocus, I decided to work with it. I needed something more persistent than a notification, but less intrusive than a colleague pinging me on Slack. After experimenting with various apps and finding them lacking, I turned to iOS Shortcuts.

The result? A simple but effective solution: a shortcut that scans my calendar and creates actual alarms for each meeting. Not notifications – alarms. The kind you can't ignore. The kind that demands attention and pulls you out of even the deepest focus state.

It works beautifully in its simplicity: triple tap the back of my phone, and the shortcut springs into action. It cleans out old alarms, scans my calendar, and sets up new alarms for the day's events. No bells and whistles (well, actually, yes bells – but you know what I mean).

## Why Share This?

Reading "The Slight Edge" by Jeff Olson and "Rework" by DHH fundamentally changed how I view personal projects. They helped me realize that the most valuable solutions often come from solving your own problems authentically, rather than trying to build what you think others want.

Oliver Berkman's course on the Waking Up app further crystallized this thinking. His discussion of finitude – the reality that we can't do everything – pushed me to focus on what truly matters. For me, that meant creating tools that actually solve real problems I face daily.

That's what Oi-U! is about. It's not just another productivity tool – it's a solution born from personal necessity, refined through daily use, and shared with the hope that it might help others who struggle with similar challenges.

## What's Next?

Right now, I'm building this website in my spare time, approaching it as a product manager would, but with a personal touch. I'm learning about website creation, exploring marketing (the authentic kind, not the pushy stuff), and seeing where this journey takes me.

Is this going to revolutionize the productivity space? Maybe not. But it's already changed how I work, and if it helps even a few others maintain their deep focus while staying connected to their commitments, I'll consider that a win.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. Do you struggle with similar challenges? Has the Oi-U! shortcut helped you? Let me know – this is just the beginning of the conversation.

*P.S. If you're wondering about the name "Oi-U!" – think of it as that friendly nudge you get from a colleague, but in digital form. A gentle "Oi!" to bring you back to the present moment when you need it most.*
