Over the past year, Reflect has transformed from just another app I was trialling into a cornerstone of my daily productivity and thought organisation. My journey with tools in this space has been extensive (and probably bordering on toxic), covering OneNote, Evernote, Obsidian, Notion, and Roam, to mention a few. Yet, none have resonated with me as deeply or as enduringly as Reflect.

This week brought a new aspect of engagement with Reflect; Sam Claassen, from Reflect, reached out to me to help test their new referral process. This request held particular resonance, given my recent involvement in refining a similar process at Hive.

Reflect's role in my routine is multifaceted, serving not only as a space for capturing thoughts but also as a powerful tool for organising my workload. The introduction of AI, particularly through customisable prompts, has revolutionised how I approach note-taking and task management, offering a powerful yet elegant solution that I hadn't encountered elsewhere. Add to that, being able to 'chat' with search results of my notes and, at last, all that information I've been squirrelling away is now actually useful!

Therefore, I'm delighted to share with you the [Reflect Referral Link](https://reflect.app/?utm_source=referral&utm_medium=testlink&utm_campaign=MIWNo8BvykaXIAtxGnVxAdmmZkR2). My hope is that you'll explore its capabilities and discover the same level of alignment and utility that I have. What do I gain from this? Beyond the satisfaction of supporting a team behind a product that has significantly enhanced my productivity, I'm also enticed by the prospect of receiving one of Sam's Reflect stickers he's promised me if someone signs up with my link. There's something about a well-designed sticker that just feels right 🙂

In sharing this, my aim is not just to promote Reflect but to contribute to a culture of sharing tools and practices that can enhance our professional and personal lives. Here's to finding what fits us best, and to the joy of a good sticker!

*Update: I've since moved to Obsidian as my primary note-taking system – but Reflect remains an excellent choice for those who want something more polished out of the box.*
