Welcome to my corner of the internet. This is where I'll be sharing insights, experiences, and learnings across a few different areas that I'm passionate about.

## What to Expect

**Product Management & AI** - The main focus of this blog. I'll be writing about:
- Building and shipping products in the age of AI
- Product strategy and decision-making frameworks
- AI tools and their impact on product development
- Lessons learned from the PM trenches

**The Motorsport Corner** - For when I need a break from pixels and want to talk about:
- Sim racing adventures and setups
- MX-5 ownership experiences
- Track days and driving techniques
- The intersection of technology and motorsport

## Why This Blog?

In a world where everyone's optimizing for engagement and algorithmic reach, I wanted a simple space to share what I'm learning and thinking about. No pressure, no perfect prose - just honest reflections on building products, exploring AI, and occasionally turning left (and right).

Thanks for stopping by.
